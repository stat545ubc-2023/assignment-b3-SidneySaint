### Welcome to my first Shiny app! This is a project assigned by STAT 545B, wherein students are asked to develop a simple, interactive Shiny app. Mine is developed to facilitate the examination of violent crime data from USA in the 70s, and how trends in this violent crime might relate to population density.  

More specifically, this app produces a plot of the murder incidence, by the assault incidence in each US state in 1973. Users can toggle a slider on the UI (user interface) to filter the states whose data appear in that plot based on what percent of their population lives in urban areas. The same is true for a data table of the violent crime data. 

Data are from R Datasets "USArrests" (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/USArrests). More details on this data set, including its original source: **McNeil, D. R.** (1977) *Interactive Data Analysis*. New York: Wiley, are available in other corresponding R Documentation (https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/USArrests.html).


## This repository is structured as follows:

  This is the essence of the app. It contains the code that defines the input and output of what appears on its user interface.
